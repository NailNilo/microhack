-ideas:
 -merge EDM (Electronic Document Management) and DMS (Document Management System) into one fonctional system.
- easy to use UI/UX to fight user resistance.
-integrate ai to classify data from a heavely tranied model and extract forms.


 problems:
 -complexity. --> must be a robust system,seamless data sync and comptability with variours data formats and devices.
 -scalability. -->storage, prossesing power and user concurrency.
 -security. --> 
 -cost--> use and api and make it easy to use so we can reduce the cost to fight the yearly subs.
-problem with intergate with old systems--> we integrate slowly.
